 * decrement to the counter of numbers that have the shared data. When this
 * reaches 0 it means that all the `NumInfo` of given *request* are ready to be
 * packed together. In reality though, the packaging is already given as the
 * `GoldbachResults` shared data object itself, so it produces said object in a
